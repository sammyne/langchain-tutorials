    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will familiarize you with LangChain's [document loader](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/retrieval#document-loaders), [embedding](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/retrieval#embedding-models), and [vector store](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/retrieval#vector-store) abstractions. These abstractions are designed to support retrieval of data--  from (vector) databases and other sources -- for integration with LLM workflows. They are important for applications that fetch data to be reasoned over as part of model inference, as in the case of retrieval-augmented generation, or [RAG](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/retrieval).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will build a search engine over a PDF document. This will allow us to retrieve passages in the PDF that are similar to an input query. The guide also includes a minimal RAG implementation on top of the search engine.\n",

    "### Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide focuses on retrieval of text data. We will cover the following concepts:\n",

    "* [Embeddings](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/text_embedding);\n",
